The global fashion and textile trade system is complex and established by layered
supply chains involving many countries. Although in recent years the
industry has tried to make efforts to become more transparent and governments have
been adopting more textile-specific policies, significant
inefficiencies in international trade persist and they are particularly driven by
fragmented policies between trading partner countries and weak regulatory
environments. Academic and industry research mostly focus
on the environmental impacts of fashion and labour conditions, but it
largely overlooks how policy and regulation affect trade and the efficiency of the
industry in this context.

This study wanted to respond to the industry’s pressing need for research on the global policy
environment and what it means for the countries’ economies. Regulatory quality and
trade balances will be analysed quantitatively, hoping to uncover insights and patterns
of the global dynamics, and ultimately contribute to more effective data-based
policymaking in the fashion industry as well as cross-country collaboration.
